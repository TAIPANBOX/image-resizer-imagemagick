This is a stripped-down copy of https://github.com/gographics/imagick/ .

The copy was nesessary, because the original didn't work out-of-the-box with
too old default ImageMagick library provided by ubuntu 12.04.

Additional functionality provided by ImageMagick can be easily added here -
just see the source code and http://www.imagemagick.org/script/magick-wand.php .
